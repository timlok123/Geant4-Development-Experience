# Geant4-Development-Experience

## Description

This GitHub Repository is set up to record my learning during the Overseas Research Fellowships(ORF) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research(CERN). It is my pleasure to join the Geant4 development team and implement the charge exchange processes in [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/). 

Detailed description of my work will be explained in the report attached.

## Credit

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof Vladimir Ivanchenko for his support during my stay at CERN. It is all the inspiring discussion we have in the evening that contributes to the implementation of the code.
